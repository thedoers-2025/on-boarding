## ðŸš€ Onboarding Steps for The Doers: Build GenAI-Powered Projects Every 15 Days

### 1. Understand the Mission
- The goal is to build and ship GenAI-powered projects every 15 days.
- Every project should leverage AI tools like GPT-4, Claude, or open-source LLMs.

### 2. Join the Community
- To join, you must either:
	- Submit a project (GitHub link to something youâ€™ve built; it must be readable & runnable).
	- OR pitch an idea (document or present it clearly).
- Only active builders are onboarded.

### 3. Choose Your Path
- After joining, you can:
	- Work on your own idea and build it into a product.
	- OR pick a project from the open catalog and start contributing.

### 4. Follow the 15-Day Sprint Cycle
#### Week 1: Ideate & Plan
- Sharpen your concept.
- Validate it with peers.
- Create a clear plan.

#### Week 2: Build & Release
- Build using GenAI, Web, or DevOps tools.
- Launch your MVP.
- Demo your work publicly.

### 5. Ship and Share
- At the end of each sprint:
	- Ship something real.
	- Demo it in front of the community.
	- Publish it on LinkedIn, your personal site, or resume.
- Everything you build adds to your public portfolio.

### 6. Build in Public
- Share your demos, learnings, and code to LinkedIn, GitHub, and beyond.

### 7. Collaborate and Grow
- Collaborate with other builders.
- Learn by doing: hands-on work with GenAI, full-stack tools, automation, and DevOps.
- Grow your career: every project boosts your visibility and credibility.

### 8. Stay Consistent
- The only rule: you must build and ship something every 15 days.
